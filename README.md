```bash
# Install fullstack environment with Python
brewdev setup fullstack python

# Install backend environment with Node.js
brewdev setup backend node

# Install AI & ML environment
brewdev setup ai-ml

# Custom installation
brewdev setup custom
```

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
```bash
brewdev gui
```

### Available Commands

```bash
brewdev setup [type] [language]    # Install development environment
brewdev uninstall [type] [lang]   # Uninstall development environment
brewdev gui                       # Run the GUI menu
brewdev --help                    # Show help message
brewdev --version                 # Show version information
```

### Setup Types

- `fullstack`: Install fullstack environment
- `backend`: Install backend environment
- `ai-ml`: Install AI & ML environment
- `custom`: Custom installation

### Languages (for fullstack/backend)

- `python`: Python
- `node`: Node.js
- `java`: Java
- `go`: Go

## Post-Installation

After installation, you might need to:

1. Log out and log back in for PATH changes to take effect, or
2. Run the following command:
```bash
source /etc/profile
```

## Verification

To verify the installation:
```bash
brewdev --version
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall tools, you can use either:

1. **CLI Mode**:
```bash
brewdev uninstall fullstack python
brewdev uninstall backend node
brewdev uninstall ai-ml
```

2. **GUI Mode**:
```bash
brewdev gui
```
Then select "Uninstall Tools" from the main menu.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you get a "command not found" error after installation:
   - Log out and log back in
   - Or run `source /etc/profile`

2. If you need to install Git first:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

3. For different Linux distributions:
   - Modify the installation commands to use your package manager
   - For RHEL/CentOS: use `yum`
   - For Fedora: use `dnf`
